# Hello-World
First repository
For what it's worth
It's never too late or in my case,too early to be whoever you want to be
There's no time limit,start whenever you want
You can change,or stay the same,there are no roles to this thing
We can make the best or worst of it
And I hope you see thing that startle you
I hope you feel things you never felt before
I hope you meet people with a different point of view
I hope you live a life you're proud of
If you find that you're not
I hope you have the strength to start all over again
